Pulse
=====

Do great things, one accomplishment at a time.

## Vision

A community that enables individuals to accomplish great things.

## Execution

`Pulse` will be a single-page app centered around a chronological stream of accomplishments. Its primary purpose is to encourage people to accomplish small things. Its secondary purpose is to deter atrophy.

### The Stick

Atrophy in the community immediately affects everyone. Artificial lag is introduced so that "passive" actions like commenting on accomplishments becomes progressively more difficult to perform. This deters unproductive and unsightly comment threads. Emails will be sent out to laggards, encouraging them to share a recent accomplishment.

### The Carrot

Accomplished users can bask in the praise of their peers and watch as they rise on the leaderboard. In future updates, we should further gamify this by adding badges. Sharing accomplishments also temporarily lifts the artificial lag, which should lead to praise and thanks from the community.
